## ‚ú® Description

This plugin provides a bridge between neovim and the [goose](https://github.com/block/goose) AI agent, creating a chat interface while capturing [editor context](#-context) to enhance your prompts. It maintains persistent sessions tied to your workspace, allowing for continuous conversations with the AI assistant similar to what tools like Cursor AI offer.

## üìù Context

The following editor context information is automatically captured and included in your conversations. This contextual information helps Goose understand what you're working on and provide more relevant assistance.

| Context Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Current File | Path to the file currently open in the editor |
| Selected Text | Text currently selected in visual mode |
| Selected Lines | Line numbers of the current selection (start, end) |
| Cursor Position | Current cursor position (line, column) |
| Additional Files | Other relevant files you've added to the conversation |

<a id="file-mentions"></a>
### Adding more files to context through file mentions

You can reference files in your project directly in your conversations with Goose. This is useful when you want to ask about or provide context about specific files. Type `@` in the input window to trigger the file picker. 
Supported pickers include [`fzf-lua`](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua), [`telescope`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), [`mini.pick`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-pick.md), [`snacks`](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/picker.md)
