## ‚ú® Description

This plugin provides a bridge between neovim and the [goose](https://github.com/block/goose) AI agent, creating a chat interface while capturing editor context (current file, selections) to enhance your prompts. It maintains persistent sessions tied to your workspace, allowing for continuous conversations with the AI assistant similar to what tools like Cursor AI offer.

### Adding more files to context through file mentions

You can reference files in your project directly in your conversations with Goose. This is useful when you want to ask about or provide context about specific files. Type `@` in the input window to trigger the file picker. 
Supported pickers include [`fzf-lua`](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua), [`telescope`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), [`mini.pick`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-pick.md), [`snacks`](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/picker.md)
