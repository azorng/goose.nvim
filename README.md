## ‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development Stage

**Note:** This plugin is in the early stages of development. Expect significant changes and improvements as the project evolves.

## ‚ú® Description

This Neovim plugin provides a simple bridge between Neovim and the Goose AI agent CLI. It runs Goose commands with appropriate context from the editor, bringing AI assistant capabilities directly into Neovim similar to what tools like Cursor AI offer. Work with a powerful AI agent without leaving your editor.

## üìã Requirements

- Goose CLI installed and available in your PATH

## ‚ö° Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Goose CLI version 1.0.17. 
Future versions may work but are not guaranteed. If you encounter issues with newer Goose CLI versions, please report them in the issues section.
